					<p>I'm a huge sucker for cool gear. I've been working and reworking my survival kit since I was 7 years old, and I still have one with me in my house. Pictured to the left is the backpacking setup that I've put together for my last couple of trips</p>

					<p>The three folding knives I own. From top to bottom: the Toologic SL3 fire, the Victorinox 1 handed Trekker NS, the Kershaw Skyline, a Mora Companion (stainless), and the Fallkniven F1.</p>
					<p>Each of these knives are pretty sweet in their own way. The Skyline weighs in at just over 70 grams, and combined with its slim profile and simple design it's perfect for urban carry and day use. The Trekker is more of a woodsman knife, and it has a pretty powerful wood saw, awl, and locking bottle opener, and of course the classic can opener and screw driver. However, there is a little vertical blade play, and while the left liner lock and rounded tip are designed for emergency safety, I think they're a slight inconvenience for my more mundane woodsman tasks. It has a heftier weight than the Skyline at 136 grams. Nevertheless, the one handed opening and the surprisingly powerful saw make it my goto for backpacking trips and forays into the woods. The Toologic SL3 is another great backpacking/survival knife. I got this knife when I was around ten years old and still use it today. It has a built in whistle and firesteel and manages to maintain a solid feel. All too often these types of multipurpose knives end up gimmicky and weak, but so far its durability has held up quite well. I'm not a huge fan of partially serrated knives as I like to use the base of the blade for carving, but since this is more of a survival knife than a bushcraft knife I have no complains. This is a nice knife to have, and probably the item I'd choose as the number one thing I'd want in the woods if I was stranded due to its plethora of uses. It's also only 85 grams, so it'll easily slip into your pocket and disappear.</p>
				  <p>The Mora and the F1 are my two purchased fixed blade knives (Alex forged a large chopper and a tiny slicer that I use). They're both pretty light and cover similar uses. I purchased the Mora for $5 off of some deal on Amazon and I like the scandi grind for easy sharpening and woodwork. But besides that I'm not a huge fan. The Mora seems too light and cheap to be used for any sort of moderately heavy duty tasks, and I don't really get how people can use this as their main blade. Maybe I just like hefty knives. Anyways, the Fallkniven F1 is the perfect mix for me. It's light but sturdy, wide enough to baton well and delicate enough to do pretty much any fine carving task I can think of. The tang extends through the butt and makes for a nice hammer in certain situations, and the convex grind means there's quite a lot of metal behind the blade. Good since I don't like carrying a stone! In my opinion it's the perfect midrange knife, and accompanied with a hatchet or chopper blade and a folder it makes the ideal complete woodsman set. I opted for the zytel sheath, and while unremarkable it gets the job done. The only complaint I have is that the 90 degree spine of the blade gives my left thumb blisters when I push through a lot of whittling. I get that it's a survival knife and it can strike a firesteel if you lose your striker, but I'd rather have just a small portion of the spine be grinded to a sharp 90. But that's a nitpicky complaint and I couldn't be happier with it, I've wanted a Fallkniven A1 or F1 for almost 10 years now!</p>

					<p>A homemade firesteel I carved up during 2018's spring break. The wood matches my knife! I think it's a stylish neckpiece, although my family disagrees.</p>
