						<h1>Outdoor Gear</h1>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="../images/gear.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>I'm a huge sucker for cool gear. I've been working and reworking my survival kit since I was 7 years old, and I still have one with me in my house. Pictured to the left is the backpacking setup that I've put together for my last couple of trips</p>
					<p>My plan right now is to swap out the heavy two person tent for a hammock/tarp combination to save space and weight.</p>
					<p>Individual pictures for the gear list might come out at some point if I get around to it. I normally carry my survival tin and a Victorinox Trekker one-handed non-serrated knife/saw combo when I'm out in the woods. Joining the party is the knife Alex forged me once we ship it over to California.</p>

								<td>Insulated Static V5, R rating of 4.4, good enough for most any weather and very small/convenient. Got at Costco for ~$60.</td>

								<td>Backpacking Wood Stove</td>
								<td>Huhu collapsable stove, $16. Picked it up for when campfires aren't allowed, it's decent but requires a lot of wood processing to burn well.</td>

							<tr>
								<td>Pack</td>
								<td>Osprey Atmos 65 AG, $170. I've been very happy with it, it's convenient and distributes weight well for long trips.</td>
