					<p>I'm a huge sucker for cool gear. I've been working and reworking my survival kit since I was 7 years old, and I still have one with me in my house. Pictured to the left is the backpacking setup that I've put together for my last couple of trips</p>
					<p>It's definitely a heavy pack right now (with food for 2-3 days it's around 35 pounds) but for the shorter trips I've been going on it hasn't been an issue. The tent is definitely the major contributor to the weight and would probably be the first thing to replace if I'm trying to go ultralight. But for now, it's nice to have a two person tent because it gives me more room and the option to take a friend if need be. I also got it for free from my uncle James, which is a nice bonus.</p>
					<p>I'll add some specs on some more of my gear in the future when I have less homework...</p>
