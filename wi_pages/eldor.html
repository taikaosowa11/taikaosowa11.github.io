					<p>The last trip I went on this summer was a 28 mile overnight loop trip in El Dorado National Forest. Unlike most hikes I've gone on, this one doesn't really follow a river. Instead, we went on a winding path through several meadows and lakes as we explored the Tahoe Rim and Pacific Trest trails.</p>
					<p>I actually wrote a short essay about this (a stream of consciousness first draft) for my English 91 class. I included it down below just for fun.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey everyone! I just got
                    back from a quick overnight backpacking trip with my friend
                    Randy Friedman. We hiked a 28 mile loop on parts of the Tahoe Rim Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had planned out the route the night before. Randy had driven up to Stanford from LA and had a couple extra days before he had to head back down for work. I was excited: this was a chance for the adventure that I’d been craving for the entire school year! A trip into El Dorado National Park: an isolated location with almost no people and stunning lakes and meadows. I was craving the feeling of emptiness that’s only satiated by the outdoors. Plus, I was accompanied by a close friend fit enough that we could powerwalk our way through the woods and push each other to go harder.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting there couldn’t have been easier. We plopped the location I found yesterday into Google Maps and boom, we were off. We parked at a random abandoned parking lot off the side of the highway and began our descent into the valley. There’s a special feeling that comes with starting an adventure: starting something new outside of your comfort zone that breaks the monotony of previous months.
					<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trip itself was great. We saw shooting stars, made campfires, jumped in lakes, had long talks to alleviate the pain of walking 14+ miles, and saw many breathtaking vistas. But what mattered the most wasn’t the physical aspect of any of it. The feeling of freedom, of relying on only the things on my back, of being able to just sit and breathe and be away from everyone and everything, was the greatest thing I did this summer.</p>
