					<p>This was a great trip that involved very little planning and a lot of fun doing something unique. The payload launched on the balloon had a camera that oriented towards the sun and got a couple images of the eclipse from high altitude (the above picture was taken from the ground by Anjali though). It was quite a long drive back with traffic and we ended up going from 1 pm to 4 am or something like that. It was a great experience though, and it reminded me of how cool and exciing things can be if only you decide to get out and go for it. The eclipse itself was amazing, and probably the most magical thing I've seen in my life. I felt like it connected me back through human history in that we've all shared that sense of wonder and amazement when we see the corona wisp out from behind the moon.</p>
