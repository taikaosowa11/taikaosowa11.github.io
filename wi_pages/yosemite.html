						<h1>Hiking Yosemite Falls</h1>

					<p>Our dorm took a trip up to Yosemite spring of 2017.</p>
					<p>It was a fun hike up to the top of Yosemite Upper Falls; my first in a while (freshman year was hectic). It wasn’t an incredibly long hike, (round trip came out to just over 7 miles), but the elevation gain was killer. I think around two and a half thousand feet. The last third of the hike was basically a gigantic natural staircase. We were very fortunate to make the hike this spring, right after all the snow that had fallen during the winter. The waterfalls were gigantic, roaring down with the force of an explosion. The last time I had been to Yosemite was around a decade ago, and I remember the waterfalls fizzled out well before they reached the ground. Not this time. By the time we got within a quarter miles distance from the base of the upper falls, the air was thick with mist.</p>
					<p>I think the biggest value of this trip, while being beautiful in itself, was the reminder of the beauty of nature and of peaceful solitude. Freshman year was crazy and fun and filled with new experiences and people, but that explosion of activity forced out some of the other aspects of my life that I enjoy: hiking, reading, writing, running. Sitting on the porch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, thinking. The part of life that we all wish we had more time for, but is the first thing we cast away when we have emails or appointments or meetings. Anyways, in this case I knowingly put that part of my life on pause. I wanted to dive headfirst into college without a lifeline. I did so, and enjoyed it immensely, but I’ve begun to swim back to the shallows. This trip out into Yosemite showed me just how close the beauty of the Sierras were to where I lived, like an untapped gold mine waiting to be explored.</p>
