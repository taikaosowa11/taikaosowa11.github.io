						<h1>HomesteadingPi</h1>
						<p>A homestead automation device integrated with an integrated
							online calculator that informs you of your environmental impact on the planet.</p>
					</header>
          <p>Coming soon! I need to figure out how to embed the program in here.
						 I'll link the github eventually.</p>
					<p>The homestead pi automates garden watering, chicken coops, home
						security, and more for the homesteading tech enthusiast. It
						 uses Open Weather API to plan your home around the events of nature,
						 and communicates with your phone via IFTTT.</p>
          <p>Data entries: make/model of car, miles driven/year (plus average
          mpg if available), water utility bill, electricity bill, types of
          foods consumed, average flights/year. One difference I am planning
          into my test is providing a series of direct resources to reducing
          each individual impact, and also providing contextual information
          about each carbon-producing action (how many trees would need to be
          planted to counteract the effect, etc). I really believe the future
          lies in sustainable development, with distributed food and energy
          production, closer communities, and a more in-tune relationship with
          nature.</p>
