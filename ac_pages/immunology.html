					<p>I spent a couple summers doing immunology research, as well as during the school year of my senior year.</p>

					<p>I've conducted research projects in immunology and neuroscience, mainly focusing on epigenetics.</p>

									<h4>(2015-2016) Investigating Mechanism of Dendritic Cell Allergen Response to Ara h2</h4>
									<p>Investigated the effect of Ara h2 allergen on dendritic cell activation in a canine <i>in vitro</i> model. Research conducted with Hasan Ahmad under Dr. Andrea Cobb in the TJHSST Biotechnology lab.<br />

									<p><br />Our research proposes that an allergen is responsible for the widespread disease <i>atopic dermatitis</i> by errantly activating dendritic cells that travel near the skin during circulation. Atopic dermatitis is an extremely common disease with more than 3 million cases in the United States every year, and its underlying cause is still unknown. By testing canine dendritic cells for activation under a common allergen, we hoped to identify a new pathway for this disease. Our results were ultimately inconclusive, but in the process we did develop a cheaper methods of differentiating canine PBMC into dendritic cells using phytohaemagglutinin! Dendritic cells make up less than .1% of leukocytes, so this method could actually save considerable amounts of money (and blood!) with further corroboration.</p>

								<h4>(Summer of 2015) Testing DNA Methylated Oligonucleotide as Mechanism for Induced Treg Cell Formation via <i>FOXP3</i> Methylation (Research Intern)</h4>
								<p>Worked with <a href="https://microbiology.georgetown.edu/faculty/bellanti" target="_blank">Dr. Bellanti</a> at Georgetown's <a href="https://microbiology.georgetown.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Microbiology and Immunology.</a> to test methylated DNA oligonucleotide. Proposed tetrahydrofolate as alternative chemical inducer of FOXP3 methylation (research ongoing).</p>
							</div>
								<p><br />Treg cells are the body's natural immunosuppressents. They play a key role in maintaining the balance of activity of the immune system. This research is significant because it suggests two possible epigenetic modifiers (methylated oligonucleotide DNA and tetrahydrofolate) that would naturally convert helper tcells to treg cells. In instances of immune system hyperactivation (autoimmune disease, organ transplants) this would provide a natural way to even out the balance of immune system activation and suppression. This is highly favorable compared to current methods, which generally have to suppress most of the immune system functions and leaves the patient susceptible to contracting other diseases.</p>
