					<p>"RaspEE aims to emulate a classical Werhmacht Engima 1 electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine used in World War II to encode and decode messages. It was famously cracked by Allied cryptologists with the aid of computer-science fame Alan Turing."</p>
					<p>I took CS107E spring of 2017, a class that teaches C (and a little ARM assembly) using baremetal coding on the raspberry pi. The enigma machine was our end-of-class project. Our group (me, Eldrick, and John) built a computational model of an enigma machine, complete with software implementations of rotors, reflection disks, and plugboards. We also built a mechanical model of the lightboard hooked up to a ps2 keyboard for input and a ps2 monitor to display the inner workigs of the machine.</p>
					<p>Most of the project was written baremetal in C on the Raspberry Pi A+, using code we had previously developed over the course as a library to base our work off of. I think we might have written a little assembly to interface with the speaker in the box that made a click noise when the rotors shifted.</p>
